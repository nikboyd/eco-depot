* so: the ECO depot _stores_ drums
* so: drums _contain_ hazardous chemicals,
* and: a storage drum _contains_ a hazardous chemical
* so: the EPA _classifies_ hazardous chemicals with EPA hazard types
* so: the EPA _issues_ a storage license to a storage facility

### Implications

* an EPA hazard type describes a hazardous chemical
* EPA hazard types = type 1, type 2, type 3
* a storage facility stores drums (containing hazardous chemicals)
* a storage license permits storage of specific chemical types

### Open Questions

* How often does the EPA renew the licenses? Quarterly? Annually?
* What are the renewal criteria? Physical inspection and certification?
* Does ECO want to store more types of hazardous chemicals?
* How would it qualify? Three years of continuous safety certifications?
* Can a storage license be revoked? What are the consequences?
* What about leaks and spills? How are they handled? What consequences?
* How long does each drum last? How are old drums replaced and recycled?
