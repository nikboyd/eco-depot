and administrative staff."

### Implications

* the ECO depot _contains_ both storage buildings and staff buildings
* a staff building _houses_ some staff members
* a storage building _stores_ some drums

### Additional Concepts

There are holes evident in the original narrative. Many of them were filled during the analysis
through _semantic implication_. However, a few important elements of the domain are still missing.
Also, several depot management system use-cases are implied.
We need to make those use-cases explicit and supply the missing domain elements.

_Where is each building located?_
* a depot map locates the depot buildings
* their physical locations determine which buildings neighbor each other

_How is the building information maintained?_
* for each storage building, a depot manager enters building description into the system

Each building description includes:
* a (unique) building identifier
* a physical description, including physical dimensions
* a physical location of the building within the depot, its address
* building identifiers of the neighboring buildings, in the depot map
* a drum storage limit from the building’s drum storage license
* an initial drum inventory
