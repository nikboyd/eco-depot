[Quote:][narrative]
"Once all the drums have been checked in, any discrepancies between the checked load and the manifest
are reported to the loading bay clerk.
The system then produces a drum-to-building allocation list that says where each drum is to be stored.
The loading bay clerk is notified of any drums that must be returned to the truck because of lack of space."

### Derivations

* a loading bay clerk checks all the drums
* the system reports any discrepancies to a loading bay clerk
* the system produces a drum-to-building allocation list
* a drum-to-building allocation list says in which storage building to store each drum
* the system notifies a loading bay clerk of any returned drums

### Implications

* a loading bay clerk notifies the system of a checked drum load
* the system produces a discrepancy report for a loading bay clerk
* the system produces a drum allocation report for a loading bay clerk
* a drum storage allocation report lists the drum storage allocations for a drum load
* a drum storage allocation identifies the storage building for each accepted drum
* the system allocates some drums to a storage building
* the system produces a returned drum report for a loading bay clerk

### Additional Concepts

There are holes evident in the original narrative. Many of them were filled during the analysis
through _semantic implication_. However, a few important elements of the domain are still missing.
Also, several depot management system use-cases are implied.
We need to make those use-cases explicit and supply the missing domain elements.

_What is a discrepancy?_
* a discrepancy exists when a checked load drum count does not match the delivery manifest drum count

A discrepancy report lists:
* the drum load EPA hazard type
* the checked load drum count
* the delivery manifest drum count
* difference between them

_What is a returned drum report?_

A returned drum report lists:
* the drum load EPA hazard type
* the returned drum count
