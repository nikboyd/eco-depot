"Drum collections are initiated by the loading bay clerk, who types in an order manifest
for the number and type of drums that are required.
The system identifies the drums that are to be retrieved from the storage buildings.
A manifest for the order is sent to the loading bay clerk."

### Implications

* a loading bay clerk _enters_ a collection order _into_ the system
* a collection order _lists_ a drum count for each hazard type
* the system _produces_ a collection manifest for a loading bay clerk
* a collection manifest _lists_ the drum locations
* a drum location _identifies_ the storage building for each drum in a collection
* a building identifier _locates_ some drums

### Additional Concepts

There are holes evident in the original narrative. Many of them were filled during the analysis
through _semantic implication_. However, a few important elements of the domain are still missing.
Also, several depot management system use-cases are implied.
We need to make those use-cases explicit and supply the missing domain elements.

_How does a loading bay clerk initiate a collection?_
* the system presents loading bay operations to a loading bay clerk
* a loading bay clerk selects drum collection from the loading bay operations
* a loading bay clerk enters a drum count and EPA hazard type into the system

_How is a collection ended?_
* a loading bay clerk notifies the system of a collected drum load
* the system removes the collected drums from the drum inventory
