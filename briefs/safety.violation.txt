"While the EPA requires that type 1 and type 2 must not be stored in the same building,
type 3 can be stored with either type 1 or type 2.
If either of these regulations is violated, then the EPA will close the depot as unsafe, pending emergency action."

<td style="vertical-align:top">

* “stored” = _stores_
* unsafe – un + ty = safety
* complies – s + ance = safety compliance
* violated – ed + ion = safety violation

</td>
<td style="vertical-align:top">

* so: a building _stores_ type 1, type 2, or type 3
* so: the EPA publishes safety regulations
* so: the EPA requires safety compliance
* so: a safety regulation defines safety violation

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Implications

* the EPA will close the depot if a safety violation occurs
* the EPA will reopen the depot only after the depot restores safety compliance
* a depot closure thereafter requires emergency corrective action by the depot

### Compliance

* safety compliance exists if a building that stores type 3 also stores type 1
* safety compliance exists if a building that stores type 3 also stores type 2
* a safety violation exists if a building that stores type 1 also stores type 2
