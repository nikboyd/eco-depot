### Mission Themes

* the depot management system _prevents_ a safety violation

### Additional Concepts

There are holes evident in the original narrative. Many of them were filled during the analysis
through _semantic implication_. However, a few important elements of the domain are still missing.
Also, several depot management system use-cases are implied.
We need to make those use-cases explicit and supply the missing domain elements.

_How does the depot manager **manage** the depot?_
* the system presents the available depot management operations to a depot manager
* a depot manager selects depot status report from the depot management operations
* the system presents a depot status report

_What data does a depot status report provide?_

Each depot status report lists:
* each building that has an EPA safety violation
* a building summary for each storage building
* pairs of vulnerable buildings

A building summary includes:
* a building identifier
* a building drum storage limit
* a building drum inventory summary
* a drum count for each stored hazard type

_How does the depot manager **maintain** depot building data?_
* a depot manager selects building maintenance from the depot management operations

_What are the essential usage cases for the following operations?_
* adding a building – storage / staff
* updating the drum inventory of a storage building
* removing a building – storage / staff (needed?)
