"When a truck arrives at the loading bay, the clerk enters the manifest accompanying the load and
checks in the drums one at a time. As each drum is checked in, it is assigned an identifier."

### Implications

* the ECO depot _contains_ a loading bay
* a truck _delivers_ a drum load _to_ the loading bay
* a drum load _contains_ drums

### Additional Concepts

There are holes evident in the original narrative. Many of them were filled during the analysis
through _semantic implication_. However, a few important elements of the domain are still missing.
Also, several depot management system use-cases are implied.
We need to make those use-cases explicit and supply the missing domain elements.

_What is the nature of a delivery manifest?_
* a delivery manifest lists the drum count for an EPA hazard type

_How does the loading bay clerk initiate a delivery?_
* the system presents loading bay operations to a loading bay clerk
* a loading bay clerk selects drum delivery from the loading bay operations
* a loading bay clerk enters a drum count and EPA hazard type into the system

_How is a drum identified?_
* a loading bay clerk requests a drum identifier from the system
* the system prints a drum identification label for each drum
* a loading bay clerk attaches a drum identification label to a drum
