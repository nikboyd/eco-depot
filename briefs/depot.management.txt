"The ECO management wants to avoid litigation from their employees or the local council.
They have introduced a company regulation that requires the depot manager be able to monitor the depot
and to always be able to check if the depot is in a vulnerable state.
The regulation states that a depot is vulnerable if any two neighboring buildings contain the maximum number of drums."

* monitor + ing = monitoring
* vulnerable + ility = **vulnerability**
* depot monitoring = _monitors_

</td>
<td style="vertical-align:top">

* so: a company regulation _requires_ depot monitoring
* 
* and: a depot manager _monitors_ the depot _for_ vulnerability
