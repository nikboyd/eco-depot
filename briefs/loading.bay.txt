[Quote:][narrative]
"Since there is only one loading bay, it must be empty before a delivery or collection can begin.
It is the clerkâ€™s responsibility to notify the system when the bay is empty."

### Derivations

* the ECO depot contains only one loading bay
* the loading bay must be empty before a delivery can begin
* the loading bay must be empty before a collection can begin
* a loading bay clerk must notify the system when the loading bay is empty

### Preconditions

* a drum delivery can begin only if the loading bay is empty
* a drum collection can begin only if the loading bay is empty

### Implications

* a loading bay clerk notifies the system when the loading bay is empty

### Additional Concepts

There are holes evident in the original narrative. Many of them were filled during the analysis
through _semantic implication_. However, a few important elements of the domain are still missing.
Also, several depot management system use-cases are implied.
We need to make those use-cases explicit and supply the missing domain elements.

_Who unloads the drums from a truck in the loading bay?_
* a drum handler transfers delivered drums from a truck into the loading bay

_What happens to the returned drums?_
* a drum handler returns drums from the loading bay onto a truck

_How are the drums collected?_
* a loading bay clerk gives a collection manifest to a drum handler
* a drum handler collects drums from the storage buildings into the loading bay
* a drum handler transfers the collected drums from the loading bay onto the truck
* a truck collects a drum load from the loading bay
