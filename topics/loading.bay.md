### Narrative Source

[Quote:][narrative]

### Additional Concepts

There are holes evident in the original narrative. Many of them were filled during the analysis
through _semantic implication_. However, a few important elements of the domain are still missing.
Also, several [depot management system][depot.management.system] use-cases are implied.
We need to make those use-cases explicit and supply the missing domain elements.
