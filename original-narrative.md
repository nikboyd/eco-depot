### ECO Depot
The ECO storage depot operates in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations
controlling the storage of environmentally damaging chemicals.

### Depot Licensing
The ECO depot is only licensed to store drums of chemicals classified as EPA hazard type 1, type 2, or type 3.

### Drum Storage
The drums are stored in special storage buildings; in the depot there are also buildings that house scientific
and administrative staff. Each storage building is licensed to hold a maximum number of drums.

### Depot Safety
While the EPA requires that type 1 and type 2 must not be stored in the same building, type 3 can be stored
with either type 1 or type 2.
If either of these regulations is violated, then the EPA will close the depot as unsafe, pending emergency action.

### Depot Management
The management has decided to install a computerized system to manage and control the depot.
It is a paramount concern that the system never allow the depot to become unsafe.

### Depot Regulation
The ECO management wants to avoid litigation from their employees or the local council.
They have introduced a company regulation that requires the depot manager be able to monitor the depot and to
always be able to check if the depot is in a vulnerable state.
The regulation states that a depot is vulnerable if any two neighboring buildings contain the maximum number of drums.

### Drum Delivery
When a truck arrives at the loading bay, the clerk enters the manifest accompanying the load and checks in the
drums one at a time. As each drum is checked in, it is assigned an identifier.

### Drum Storage Allocation
Once all the drums have been checked in, any discrepancies between the checked load and the manifest are reported
to the loading bay clerk.
The system then produces a drum-to-building allocation list that says where each drum is to be stored.
The loading bay clerk is notified of any drums that must be returned to the truck because of lack of space.

### Drum Collection
Drum collections are initiated by the loading bay clerk, who types in an order manifest for the number and
type of drums that are required. The system identifies the drums that are to be retrieved from the storage buildings.
A manifest for the order is sent to the loading bay clerk.

### Loading Bay
Since there is only one loading bay, it must be empty before a delivery or collection can begin.
It is the clerkâ€™s responsibility to notify the system when the bay is empty.
